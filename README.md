Warning!
As costs for Amazon Cloud Services are too high for Free Tier package for user and my app went over free services (238 euros charge for me in January :((((( ), I have to delete all services on Amazon.

Database MySQL is deployed to AWS via ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89829761/215286008-6ec51ec5-7ad0-4647-811c-5f629690642e.png)

SOLVE FOR AWS for back-end sides: 

I used Railway to host my Spring Boot Apis (it is free for 500 hours per month, therefore, in some days in the month, my app is crashed and can only be accessed by own localhost of individuals)

API host url: 

```bash
https://backend-for-plant-ui-production.up.railway.app
```

```bash
To start a backend folder, run: mvn clean spring-boot:run 
```

```bash
Need to cd frontend folder and run npm install beforehand.
```

```bash
To start a frontend folder, run: expo start --android or expo start --ios
```



Please download a React Native Debugger through a link: 
```bash

Link deploy (maybe crashed in some days due to limit of back-end sides deployment to Railway): 
```bash
https://expo.dev/@thongdang/frontend?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go 
```
